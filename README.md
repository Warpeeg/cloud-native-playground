# cloud-native-playground
A little playground to experiment with some cloud tech

## To run:
- "bash start.sh" to start... and laterÂ 
- "bash stop.sh" to tear it down


## kafka events
See all the initially loaded listings via the postgrest endpoint
http://localhost:3000/listing

Request a new listing to be added from the partner-web endpoint
 - this calls an API enpoint in listing-service which then triggers the a kafka event to be produced
 - a kafka consumer in the listing-service will then recieve the event and call the postgrest endpoint to add the listing to the DB
http://localhost:4100/new-listing
